# MemoryCards

Memory card game written in swift iOS 14

Can be run on iphone ipad or mac with xcode.

Cards are implemented as cells with each card assigned to a random cell at the start. The goal is to find all matching pairs before the time goes to 0. When selected the card back is replaced by the random card that was placed in that cell at the beggining. If the two cards selected match the pair is removed. If the cards are not a match then they are "flipped" back over or replaced with the holder cell that is the back of the card.
